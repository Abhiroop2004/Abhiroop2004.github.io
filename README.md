### About me
I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate at [IEM, Kolkata](https://iem.edu.in/), strongly interested in cryptography and machine learning. Currently, I am a Summer Intern at [Presidency University](https://presiuniv.ac.in/web/) under [Prof. Avishek Adhikary](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/staff.php?staffid=424), working with visual cryptography. Additionally, I serve as a Research Assistant at the Centre of Excellence for Cloud Computing & IoT under IEDC CSE.

Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue higher studies, potentially a Ph.D., with the ultimate goal of becoming a professor in the future. 👨🏼‍🏫
