## About me
- I am a  3<sup>rd</sup>-year Computer Science undergraduate at [IEM, Kolkata](https://iem.edu.in/), and I am strongly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and Cryptography. I am also interested in applications of Machine Learning in everyday problems. <br>
- Currently, I am a Long-Term Project Student under [Prof. Avishek Adhikary](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/staff.php?staffid=424) at [Presidency University](https://presiuniv.ac.in/web/), working with integrating segmentation and inpainting techniques from computer vision with Secret Image Sharing. <br>
Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue higher studies, potentially a Ph.D., with the ultimate goal of becoming a professor in the future. üë®üèº‚Äçüè´

### AgroGenie: A smart approach to agriculture using Machine Learning
- This research involves the utilization of a Machine-learning-based approach to analyze the values of several parameters influencing crop growth. It then accepts a novel set of input parameters and recommends the **most probable crops that can be cultivated**. 
- Adequate preprocessing methods have been applied to ensure the optimum removal of partiality from data. The ML models have been compared for their performance using a well-accepted validation measure, with **Random Forest** achieving a **99.6%** accuracy. 
- Then, crops with similar features have been **clustered** to provide more **flexible farming options** for the farmer. <br>
- Accepted and Presented in [ICISA-2024](https://sites.google.com/view/icisa2024). <br>

### IoT-based CO2 level monitoring system
- Worked in a team of 6 designing an IoT-enabled CO2 monitoring system using components such as NodeMCU-**esp8266**, **mq135**(gas sensor), & **dht-11**(temperature & humidity Sensor). Used **ThingSpeak** to plot data from the device.
- Provides **real-time CO2 level monitoring** in ppm, and **alarms the user** through a buzzer and LED light when the CO2 level exceeds 500 ppm.
- I worked on writing and debugging the code in Arduino IDE and calibrating the mq135.
