## 👨‍🎓 About me
- I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate at [IEM, Kolkata](https://iem.edu.in/), and I am strongly interested in cryptography and machine learning. <br>
- Currently, I am a Summer Intern at [Presidency University](https://presiuniv.ac.in/web/) under [Prof. Avishek Adhikary](https://www.presiuniv.ac.in/web/staff.php?staffid=424), working with visual cryptography and Secret Sharing. <br>
- Additionally, I serve as a Research Assistant at the Centre of Excellence for Cloud Computing & IoT under IEDC CSE, working with project Agrogenie, which involves exploring data science in agriculture. <br>
Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue higher studies, potentially a Ph.D., with the ultimate goal of becoming a professor in the future. 👨🏼‍🏫

### AgroGenie: A smart approach to agriculture using Machine Learning
- This research involves the utilization of a Machine-learning-based approach to analyze the values of several parameters influencing crop growth. It then accepts a novel set of input parameters and recommends the most probable crops that can be cultivated. 
- Adequate preprocessing methods have been applied to ensure the optimum removal of partiality from data. The ML models have been compared for their performance using a well-accepted validation measure, with Logistic Regression achieving a 99.6% accuracy. 
- Then, crops with similar features have been clustered to provide a more flexible farming option for the farmer. <br>
- Accepted and Presented in [ICISA-2024](https://sites.google.com/view/icisa2024). <br>
